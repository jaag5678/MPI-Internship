\subsection{Assumptions}
            
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Single memory. 
        \item One read per symmetric thread. 
        \item Coherence based executions.
        \item No Load Buffering. 
    \end{itemize}}

    \critic{red}{I am still uncertain if Load-buffering is even needed when we consider case of only single memory based events. In my eyes it is just coherence that is the assumption as far as the consistency rules go.}
